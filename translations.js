                <li>We do not have access to your iCloud data - it is controlled entirely by Apple and your iCloud security settings</li>
                <li>You can disable iCloud sync at any time through iOS Settings</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>iCloud Privacy</h3>

            <h2>3. Sinkronisasi iCloud</h2>
            <p>UangRumah menawarkan sinkronisasi iCloud opsional untuk menjaga data Anda tetap sinkron di seluruh perangkat Apple Anda (iPhone dan iPad).</p>

            <h3>Cara Kerja Sinkronisasi iCloud</h3>

                <li>Saat diaktifkan, data pengeluaran, anggaran, kategori, dan pusat biaya Anda secara otomatis dicadangkan ke akun iCloud pribadi Anda</li>
                <li>Data dienkripsi selama transmisi dan penyimpanan menggunakan standar keamanan Apple</li>
                <li>Hanya Anda yang dapat mengakses data ini melalui perangkat yang masuk ke akun iCloud Anda</li>
                <li>Kami tidak memiliki akses ke data iCloud Anda - ini sepenuhnya dikontrol oleh Apple dan pengaturan keamanan iCloud Anda</li>
                <li>Anda dapat menonaktifkan sinkronisasi iCloud kapan saja melalui Pengaturan iOS</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Privasi iCloud</h3>
            <p>Saat menggunakan sinkronisasi iCloud, data Anda tunduk pada Kebijakan Privasi Apple dan ketentuan iCloud. Kami merekomendasikan untuk meninjau praktik privasi Apple di <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" class="contact-link" target="_blank">apple.com/legal/privacy</a>.</p>

            <h2>4. Bagaimana Kami Menggunakan Informasi Anda</h2>

                <li><strong>Analitik & Wawasan:</strong> Untuk menghasilkan visualisasi dashboard, rincian kategori, dan laporan pengeluaran</li>
                <li><strong>Pengingat:</strong> Untuk mengirimkan notifikasi berdasarkan preferensi yang Anda konfigurasi (pengingat pengeluaran, peringatan anggaran, ringkasan bulanan)</li>
                <li><strong>Ekspor Data:</strong> Untuk membuat laporan PDF dan CSV saat Anda memintanya</li>
                <li><strong>Peningkatan Aplikasi:</strong> Untuk memahami penggunaan fitur dan meningkatkan fungsionalitas aplikasi (hanya lokal, tanpa transmisi data)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Berbagi Data dan Pihak Ketiga</h2>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>🔒 Nol Berbagi Pihak Ketiga:</strong> Kami tidak menjual, menyewakan, memperdagangkan, atau membagikan data pribadi atau keuangan Anda kepada pihak ketiga mana pun. Titik.</p>
            </div>

            <p>UangRumah beroperasi dengan privasi data yang lengkap:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Tidak ada jaringan periklanan</li>
                <li>Tidak ada integrasi media sosial</li>

                <li>Anda mengaktifkan sinkronisasi iCloud (data hanya masuk ke akun iCloud Anda)</li>
                <li>Anda mengekspor laporan (data tetap di perangkat Anda atau pergi ke tempat yang Anda pilih untuk membagikannya)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Keamanan Data</h2>
            <p>Kami menerapkan langkah-langkah keamanan standar industri untuk melindungi data keuangan Anda:</p>

            <h3>Perlindungan Teknis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Penyimpanan Lokal:</strong> Data disimpan dalam kontainer aman iOS yang dilindungi oleh enkripsi perangkat</li>
                <li><strong>Enkripsi iCloud:</strong> Saat sinkronisasi diaktifkan, data dienkripsi dalam transmisi dan saat disimpan</li>
                <li><strong>Mode Privasi:</strong> Fitur bawaan untuk mengaburkan informasi sensitif dan menyensor jumlah saat diperlukan</li>
                <li><strong>Tanpa Server Backend:</strong> Tidak ada server web atau database yang rentan yang bisa diretas</li>
                <li><strong>Keamanan iOS:</strong> Memanfaatkan infrastruktur keamanan Apple yang kuat dan pembaruan keamanan reguler</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Rekomendasi Keamanan Perangkat</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Gunakan kode sandi yang kuat atau autentikasi biometrik (Face ID/Touch ID) pada perangkat Anda</li>
                <li>Perbarui perangkat lunak iOS Anda secara teratur</li>
                <li>Aktifkan autentikasi dua faktor untuk akun Apple ID/iCloud Anda</li>
                <li>Jangan jailbreak perangkat Anda, karena ini mengkompromikan keamanan</li>
