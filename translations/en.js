        content: `<p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 17, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to UangRumah. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your financial data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use our iOS expense tracking application.</p>
        <p>UangRumah is designed specifically for Indonesian couples to manage household expenses efficiently. We believe in transparency and want you to understand exactly how your data is handled.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>UangRumah collects and stores the following types of information locally on your device and optionally in your iCloud account:</p>

        <h3>Financial Data</h3>

            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you use the app to improve functionality (stored locally only)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> All data is stored locally on your device by default. No data is sent to external servers or third-party services unless you explicitly enable iCloud sync.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>3. iCloud Synchronization</h2>
        <p>UangRumah offers optional iCloud synchronization to keep your data in sync across your Apple devices (iPhone and iPad).</p>

        <h3>How iCloud Sync Works</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>Data is encrypted during transmission and storage using Apple's security standards</li>
            <li>Only you can access this data through devices signed in to your iCloud account</li>
            <li>We do not have access to your iCloud data - it is controlled entirely by Apple and your iCloud security settings</li>
            <li>You can disable iCloud sync at any time through iOS Settings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>iCloud Privacy</h3>
        <p>When using iCloud sync, your data is subject to Apple's Privacy Policy and iCloud terms. We recommend reviewing Apple's privacy practices at <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" class="contact-link" target="_blank">apple.com/legal/privacy</a>.</p>
